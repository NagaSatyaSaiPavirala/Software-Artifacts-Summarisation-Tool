# Software Artifacts Summarisation Tool

## Problem Statement

The problem is to create a tool for Software Artifacts Summarisation. The tool assists testers in identifying closed issues related to testing by providing the GitHub repository URL. It then summarises these issues and appends the summary to the README file of the cloned GitHub repository.

## Solution Overview

### Functions Implemented:

1. **Fetching Closed Issues**:  
   Constructs a GitHub API URL to fetch closed issues of a repository and returns the JSON response.
  
2. **Printing Unique Closed Issues**:  
   Prints unique closed issues sorted by their creation date using a set to avoid duplicates.

3. **Generating Testing-Related Issues**:  
   Combines issue titles and bodies to generate content using GenAI's GenerativeModel to identify testing-related issues.

4. **Summarising Issues**:  
   Summarises testing-related issues using Transformers' BART model for text summarization.

5. **Cloning Repository**:  
   Clones the GitHub repository to a specified destination path, removing the directory if it already exists.

6. **Appending Summary to README**:  
   Appends the generated summary to the README file of the cloned repository.
This Python script performs a series of operations related to managing and analyzing GitHub repositories. It fetches closed issues, prints unique issues, generates testing-related issues, summarizes them, clones the repository, and appends the summary to the README.md file. The script leverages various libraries and APIs including `requests` for HTTP requests, `git` for repository cloning, `GenAI` for content generation, and `Transformers` for text summarization.

### Technical Information
This Python script performs a series of operations related to managing and analyzing
testing related issues of GitHub repositories for testerâ€™s perspective:

### Fetching Closed Issues
The `fetch_closed_issues` function fetches closed issues from a specified GitHub repository using the GitHub API. It constructs a URL based on the repository owner and name, sends a GET request, and returns the JSON response containing closed issues.

### Printing Unique Issues
The `print_unique_issues` function takes the fetched closed issues, sorts them by creation date, and prints unique issue details, avoiding duplicate titles.

### Generating Testing Related Issues
The `filter_testing_related_issues` function processes the titles and bodies of closed issues to generate new testing-related issues using the GenAI GenerativeModel. It appends a prompt to the combined issue titles and bodies, generates new content, and returns it.

### Summarizing Issues
The `summarise_issues` function summarizes the generated testing-related issues using the Transformers summarization pipeline with the BART-large model. It returns a concise summary of the issues.

### Cloning Repository
The `clone_repo` function clones the specified GitHub repository to a local destination path using GitPython's `Repo.clone_from` method. If a directory with the same name already exists at the destination, it removes it before cloning.

### Appending Summary to README
The `append_summary_to_readme` function appends the generated summary of testing-related issues to the README.md file in the cloned repository's directory.

The main function is a collection of these operations by taking a GitHub repository URL
from the user, parsing it to extract the repository owner and name, fetching closed issues, generating testing related issues, summarizing them, cloning the repository, and appending the summary to the README file. The script leverages various libraries and APIs including requests for HTTP requests, git for repository cloning, GenAI for content generation, and Transformers for text summarisation.

### Libraries and Techniques Used:

**Techniques:**
- API Requests
- Natural Language Generation (GenAI)
- Text Summarization (Transformers)
- Version Control (Git)

**Libraries Used:**
- `os`: For operating system dependent functionality.
- `google.generativeai`: GenAI for natural language generation.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- `urllib.parse`: For parsing URLs.
- `transformers`: For text summarization using the BART model.
- `git`: For cloning GitHub repositories.
- `shutil`: For high-level file operations like directory removal.

## Results

The tool prints unique closed issues sorted by creation date, identifies testing-related issues, generates a summary of these issues, clones the GitHub repository locally, and appends the summary to the README file.

## New Learnings

- Integration of GenAI using Gemini LLM model for content filtering.
- Text summarization using Transformers.
- Git Python library for repository cloning.
- Python error handling and debugging.
- URL parsing and manipulation with `urllib.parse`.

## Running Instructions

### Pre-requisites:

- Upload the `CS23M109 Software Artifacts Summarisation Tool.ipynb` file to Google Colab.

### Steps:

1. **Run Each Function**:  
   Execute each function in separate cells.

2. **Run Main Function**:  
   Execute the script to run the main function.

3. **Input GitHub URL**:  
   Input the GitHub repository URL when prompted.

4. **View Results**:  
   The tool will print closed issues, filtered testing-related issues, and append the summary to the README file.

### Checking Appended Summary to README:

- Open the left-side menu in Colab.
- Refresh the files section.
- A new directory named after the repository will appear.
- Click the dropdown menu to open the README file.
- Check under the section titled "Closed Issues Summary Related To Testing" for the appended summary.

### Additional Dependencies:

- **GitPython library** needs to be installed to handle GitHub API and related methods.
  
Most dependencies are pre-installed in Colab, and only the GitPython library needs to be installed.
